🔹 Brute Force — Intuition (2 lines)

Idea:
For every character, check the entire string to see if it appears anywhere else.
If a character appears only once, return its index.

Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

🔹 Better Solution (Hashing) — Intuition (2 lines)

Idea:
First count the frequency of each character using hashing.
Then scan the string again to find the first character with frequency 1.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) (26 characters)

🔹 Optimal Solution (Array Frequency) — GitHub Ready
💡 Approach

Use a fixed-size array of 26 to store character frequencies.
Traverse the string twice to identify the first unique character.

✅ C++ Code
int firstUniqChar(string s) {
    int freq[26] = {0};

    // Count frequency of each character
    for(char c : s) {
        freq[c - 'a']++;
    }

    // Find first character with frequency 1
    for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
        if(freq[s[i] - 'a'] == 1)
            return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
